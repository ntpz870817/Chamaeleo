# Note
This folder is used for end-to-end (overall process) integration testing

Step 1: using **demo_case_individual_transcode.py** to learn how to complete the encoding and decoding process.
Step 2: using **demo_case_combined_transcode.py** to learn how to compare different coding schemes.
Step 3: using **demo_case_robustness.py** to learn how to evaluate the robustness of coding schemes.
Step 4: using **demo_case_basic_feature.py** to learn how to calculate the basic features of DNA sequences encoded by different coding schemes.
Step 5: using **demo_case_best_choice.py** to learn how to find the best choice in different coding schemes.
